# template
A template project, concentrating on licenses and legal boiler plate.

This helps you conform to GFK's open source policy. For non-GFK use, please change the GFK references in CONTRIBUTING.md

This readme file explains the use of this template. Delete it but keep the rest.

Our open source policy is open source:

(it's also a work in progress...)

For GFK workers see also: 
* [Proposal for an open source policy](https://confluence.gfk.com/display/NE/Open-source+policy) which includes some of the reasoning behind our decisions
* [CoP: Open Source & Inner Source](https://confluence.gfk.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=197083289) for materials relating to the Open Source Community of Practice

# What's in it for us?
GFK uses a lot of open source. One can overcome the 'tragedy of the commons' by being deliberately generous.
GFK finds it convenient to re-use software between divisions by making it open - as long as it isn't central to our competitive advantage.
We recruit developers. If we can demonstrate the quality of our development through excellent public work, it's easier to hire good people.
Finding bugs in production is costly. We hope there aren't any but if there are, your bug reports can help them get fixed before they affect anyone else - including us.
Suggestions for new features makes tools more useful and potentially takes new feature development off projects' critical path.
